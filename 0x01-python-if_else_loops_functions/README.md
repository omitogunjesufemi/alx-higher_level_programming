# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

This project helped to understand the awesomeness of Python programming, why indentation is so important in Python, using `if, if ... else` statements, using comments, how to affect values to variables, how to use the while and for loops, how Python's 'for' different from C's, how to use the `break` and `continue` statements, how to use `range`, how to use functions, return statement of a function, scope of variables, traceback and using arithmetic operators
