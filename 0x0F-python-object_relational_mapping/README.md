# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

In this project, I linked two amazing worlds: Database and Python!
In the first part, I used the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and execute your SQL queries. In the second part, I used the module SQLAlchemy an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).
The purpose of an ORM is to abstract the storage to the usage. With an ORM, the biggest concern will be "What can I do with my objects" and not "How this object is stored? where? when?". No SQL queries only Python code. Last thing, the codebase won't be "storage type" dependent, giving the ability to change storage easily without re-writing the entire project.

This project helped to understand:
- How to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script
- How to SELECT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
- How to INSERT rows in a MySQL table from a Python script
- What ORM means
- How to map a Python Class to a MySQL table
- How to create a Python Virtual Environment

The project consist of the following tasks:
